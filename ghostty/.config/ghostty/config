# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# The template does not set any default options, since Ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. Users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on Ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# Ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: Command + Shift + comma on macOS and
# Control + Shift + comma on other platforms). Not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect.

# Config syntax crash course
# ==========================
# # The config file consists of simple key-value pairs,
# # separated by equals signs.
font-family = JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
# window-padding-x = 2
#
# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
# # All of these are identical:
# key=value
# key= value
# key =value
# key = value
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option, since it would be interpreted as a
# # part of the value. For example, this will have a value of "#123abc":
